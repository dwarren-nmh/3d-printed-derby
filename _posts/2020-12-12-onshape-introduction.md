# Starting with Onshape

Onshape is a web-based tool for designing 3D components. It's used by industry professionals for quick and fast part design. In short, it's a powerful tool that can work on nearly every computer (iPad included!). Even better, you can share your designs with others, and they can quickly go to a website to see them and give feedback.

## 1. Getting an account

To get an Onshape account you need to sign up for an educational license. A standard license is $1,500 per year, but the educational license is free while you are a student.

Go to [Onshape](https://www.onshape.com/en/education/) and sign up for an [educational plan](https://www.onshape.com/en/education/).

Be sure to use your NMH email address when you sign up for an account. You should receive a verification email quickly after signing up.

## 2. Getting Acquainted

Most tools for 3D modeling are similar, especially if they are used for creating parts to be 3D printed or machined. Watch this video for a quick tutorial on getting acquainted with Onshape before you design your first part.
